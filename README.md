In this project a static web page was converted to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. it was also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users (PWA).


## How to start the app

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

2. http-server is a simple, zero-configuration command-line http server. It is powerful enough for production usage, but it's simple and hackable enough to be used for testing, local development, and learning.

**Installation via npm:** _npm install http-server -g_

This will install http-server globally so that it may be run from the command line.

3. **Usage:** In the project folder, run _http-server -p 8000_ to start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer.

Now you can visit _http://localhost:8000_ to view your server.
